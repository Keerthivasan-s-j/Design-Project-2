                <h2>How It All Began</h2>
                <p>It all started with a realization — long EV charging times and insufficient infrastructure were major roadblocks to seamless electric mobility. We saw an opportunity to transform this challenge into an innovative solution.</p>
                <p>We dived deep into understanding user pain points, studied current limitations in the EV ecosystem, and explored how battery swapping could offer a faster, more efficient alternative to traditional charging.</p>
                <p>With a clear purpose, we set out to create a platform that blends technology, sustainability, and convenience — enabling quick battery swaps that keep users on the move and drive the future of green transportation.</p>
